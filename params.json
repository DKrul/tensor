{"name":"Tensor","tagline":"A Riemann metric source","body":"# Tensor\r\nTensor is a polling monitoring agent and metric router for Riemann. Tensor is asynchronous and able to handle polling thousands of metrics at high frequency, receiving them through other protocols, and reliably delivering them to Riemann.\r\n\r\nTensor uses a plugin architecture for input sources and outputs, and can be easily extended using Python to monitor anything or produce any metrics.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nTensor is easy to install and configure, and supports state thresholds with regex matching for sources which provide multiple metrics. ::\r\n\r\n    ttl: 60.0\r\n    interval: 1.0\r\n\r\n    sources:\r\n        - service: load\r\n          source: tensor.sources.linux.basic.LoadAverage\r\n          interval: 2.0\r\n\r\n        - service: cpu\r\n          source: tensor.sources.linux.basic.CPU\r\n          interval: 2.0\r\n          critical: {\r\n            \"^cpu$\": \"> 0.1\"\r\n          }\r\n\r\n        - service: memory\r\n          source: tensor.sources.linux.basic.Memory\r\n          interval: 2.0\r\n\r\n    outputs:\r\n        - output: tensor.outputs.riemann.RiemannTCP\r\n          server: riemann.acme.com\r\n          port: 5554\r\n          tls: true\r\n          cert: /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/test.acme.com.pem\r\n          key: /var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/test.acme.com.pem\r\n\r\nConsult the documentation for installation instructions and more configuration examples.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n[Latest documentation](http://tensor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
