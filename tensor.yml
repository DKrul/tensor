# You can set an acceptable amount of backpressure here, this is calculated
# by the number outstanding acknowledgements when the event queue is rolled up
# -1 means you don't care, 0 makes everything synchronous - but Tensor will 
# leak memory if it has to queue for a long time.
pressure: -1

# Dequeue events and send to Riemann at this rate in seconds. This basically
# decides how "realtimey" the events are. If this is longer than your source
# intervals, you'll get 'bursty' events, but they will retain the right
# timestamps.
