# Default TTL for events (default: 60 seconds)
# It should be noted if Tensor loses its connection to Riemann it will purge
# queued events if their age exceeds the TTL.
# Sources can also have a custom TTL
ttl: 60.0

# Dequeue events and send to Riemann at this rate in seconds. This basically
# decides how "realtimey" the events are. If this is longer than your source
# intervals, you'll get 'bursty' events, but they will retain the right
# timestamps.
